### JavaScript as a Dynamic Language
---
JavaScript is called a dynamic language because it allows for dynamic typing, meaning that variables can hold values of any data type and can be reassigned to different data types during execution. Additionally, JavaScript supports dynamic objects, where properties can be added or removed from objects at runtime.
